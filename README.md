# POMODORO CLOCK...
### Easy strategy to study in small timeframes with planned breaks....
## Get Out There and Pomo-Do-It!


##### 1) PROBLEMS FACED (WHY DID I COME UP WITH THIS PROJECT?)
Students all across the world do struggle with time management some or the other way. Here, in college as well as during my JEE preparation I had faced a hard time scheduling my daily tasks and breaks. Thus, it is important to have focus while working and also be able to manage your study time and break time efficiently.  Thus a technique or a tool is needed for improving the productivity and which helps cutting down on interruptions.

##### 2) PROJECT IDEA : POMODORO CLOCK
Thus to solve the above mentioned issue , I got to know about this technique called as **The Pomodoro Technique** . The basics of this technique is that you break all of your work sessions into 25-minute chunks, separated by regular short breaks. 
Any student can use this technique to keep track of their tasks that they are doing, and also to remember to take breaks between sessions to rest their eyes.
So I have come up with this project to help college students like me to manage their time and plan their study breaks efficiently.
This Pomodoro technique is so simple and powerful.The following steps can be followed while using this technique(or project):
1.Set a timer (The default is 25 minutes, however the user can edit his work session duration according to his own needs.)
2.Activate your ninja-like focus and work until the timer goes off.
3.Take a short break (The default is 5 minutes, however the user can edit his break session duration according to his own needs.)
4.Continue with next scheduled study session....

Mentally this can be an amazing motivator enabling the student to plan his/her breaks ahead of time. 


##### 3) TECH STACK:
I have implemented my project using the following:
    • HTML
    • CSS
    • JAVASCRIPT

##### 4) PROGRESS OF THE PROJECT:
So far I have implemented the basic features of a POMODORO in this project.
The default settings are of work session of 25 minutes and break session of 5 minutes. However, the user can edit these according to his/her own needs.
Then after setting the work session duration and the break session duration , the user can start the clock and continue to work until the set timer goes off.
(The user also has the option to stop the currently running Pomodoro cycle.) 
After the work session has ended , the break session starts where the user can enjoy their study break....
Having completed a single pomodoro the user can again continue his/her next scheduled study session similarly.......


##### 5) FUTURE PROSPECTS:
While making this project, I really wanted to implement some features but I was unable to.
So that’s why I m planning to improvise my current project by logging the pomodoro sessions. As in a feature, which will keep a log of all the sessions taken by the user , how many breaks did he/she take, how long were his/hers study and break sessions. 

Secondly, also a feature of editing the name of each session like the user can name his break session as a tea break or a coffee break if he/she wishes to distinguish between two breaks. Thus giving the user the feature to name his/her own tasks.

Thirdly, a feature where a longer break is provided for the user after a ceratin set of work sessions have been completed.This would keep the user motivated enough to continue using this technique.

And also a feature of PAUSE where the user can pause the currently running clock if he/she wishes to and then again resume his session after the pause from where he left.

And also one more feature of adding a sound as soon as the timer goes off so that the user is aware that the session has ended.

##### 6) REFERENCES:
As I had poor knowledge of Javascript and CSS prior to this project , I used following sites to build this project .
- https://www.w3schools.com/
- StackOverFlow

This site helped me with everything like all the commands and the syntax I had to implement.


So,

# Go Ahead and Pomo-Do-It!
